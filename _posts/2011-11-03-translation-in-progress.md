Like we said in a [previous post][2], Turpial is growing up and as part of that growing we need to teach the bird to talk in other languages. We are translating all the Turpial platform into english in order to more people can read us and enjoy our work. Probably, while we finish, you will see some parts in english and some other in spanish, but don't worry, we'll try to accomplish this as soon as possible. Thanks for all your support
