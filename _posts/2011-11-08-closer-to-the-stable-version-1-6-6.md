[][1] We've been working on what will be the next stable release (1.6.6 version) and we are every day closer. At the beginning of the past month we released the beta 6 for 1.6.5 with the last fixes to minor issues detected and at the end of October we released a new version with support for a new image uploading service (Imgur). Today we've done the first release candidate for 1.6.6 and if every goes well we should have the new stable version for this weekend. You can test the 1.6.6-rc1 from the [files repository][2] and soon we'll have packages availables for main GNU/Linux distros
