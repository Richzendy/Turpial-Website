If you are a current user of _development_ branch of Turpial, we encourage you to **NOT** perform any update at least for a couple of weeks. Because of the release of the new stable version, this branch will be under heavy development and we will be doing a lot of changes that will broke up the application. However, if after this warning you still want to test current development, do it at your own risk. To keep your Turpial working, please move to _master_ branch and stay there until further advice.
