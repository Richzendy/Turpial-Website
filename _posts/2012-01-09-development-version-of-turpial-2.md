[][1] After several weeks of hard work the new [documentation for the installation process of the current development version of Turpial][2] has been updated. Needless to say that this version is really experimental and is under heavy development, so you must expect daily changes, incomplete features and possibles bugs/issues. This version is NOT RECOMMENDED under any circumstance for production, just for testing purpose. Please, DON'T OPEN issue reports about this version until the first alpha/beta is released. If you want to contribute please leave your feedback in comments or better, make a donation to keep the bird growing :) Enjoy!
