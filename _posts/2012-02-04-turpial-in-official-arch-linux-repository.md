[][1] With the last stable release (v1.6.9), Turpial has been accepted as [official package][2] in the community Arch Linux repository. Now if you want to install the stable release in Arch Linux just execute: `# pacman -S turpial` Thanks to our friends [Miguel Ángel Useche][3] who was the maintainer of AUR package and [Angel Velásquez][4] who uploaded Turpial to community repository and is the current maintainer of the official package.
