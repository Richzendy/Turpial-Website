If you're reading this there're only two possible explanations: 

  1. You **know** what "Cayapa" means and want to be involved in it.
  2. You **Want to know** what "Cayapa" means and what does it have to do with the development of Turpial 2.0. So, here it goes, I'll try to be as clear as possible so that 

**our venezuelan lingo** can come across to anyone who's never set foot in this beautyful land filled with beautiful women (Sorry guys, they're all mine) 


  


**Cayapa**: noun. & verb. [_Kah-ya'll-pah_] (Meh, close enough) **In lame terms**: The action of beating the crap out of one S.o.B. This is not done by one subject to another but is a group efford against the one until he's pretty much left for dead. (Very invinting isn't). 

> **i.e:** We were **_cayaping_** that MoFo for using my external HD to save his reggaeton "music" \*spits on the carcas\* Now, **Who wants to be a part of the beating???** **How does it apply to Turpial development?** you ask, fairly simple, **We are the Cayapators** [Terminator style] and the requirements for a good Alpha 2.0 is the MoFo whom defiled your HD: **It needs to be set straight**. 


  
 To better understand this term, think of it as a 

**Bug Squash Party** in Techno Language. And before you ask, **NO!** this word will not change and we will **cayapa** you if you, so much as, suggest we change it. 


  Thank you.
