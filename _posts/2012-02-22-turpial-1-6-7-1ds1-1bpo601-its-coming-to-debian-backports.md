[][1]Indeed, Turpial 1.6.7-1+ds1-1~bpo60+1 its coming to Debian Backports; the package maintained by Miguel Landaeta and sponsored by Muammar El Khatib is pending for approval and soon will be available as stable for all Debian users. Turpial is not available yet on Debian as a compiled package but on the unstable or testing repositories with the 1.6.9-1 version. the stable repositories now will have it as soon as the backports ftp masters upload it which usually takes no more than 10 days. As all might know Debian is a popular and influential GNU/Linux distribution know by his great stability because the packages are exhaustedly tested to ensure security and stability but this also cause that the packages released on the stable versions might be old. To improve this a group of developers, users and collaborators created the debian backports project and they work to maintain the packages so the versions on the stable release become the recent ones.
