Last February 12th, as [result][1] of the Cayapa Turpial, we decided to set the release date for the first alpha version of Turpial 2.0 at March 4th. However, we couldn't reach this deadline due to some issues with webkit and performance that forced us to change priorities. Now, we are fixing some minor issues and polishing a couple of features required for this snapshot. Preferences dialog and a better authentication method are done, so main work this week will be focused on the embedded images features and the column autoresize and the next week will be dedicated to tests and UI improvements. The new date for the alpha release has been set to March 18th.
