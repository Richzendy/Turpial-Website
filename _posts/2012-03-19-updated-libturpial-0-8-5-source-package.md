Due the lack of some security certificates in the previous source package we had to update the pristine tarball of the recent released version of libturpial (0.8.5). The name of the package remains the same (because there are no changes on libturpial source code) and is available from our [files repository][1] through the same [URL][2] but the MD5 checksum has changed. We highly recommend to check the new checksum in order to verify that you are using the right version. We apologize for any inconvenient.
