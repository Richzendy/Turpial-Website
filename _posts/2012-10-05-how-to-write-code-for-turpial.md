Are you a developer? Would you like to collaborate with the project but you don't have idea how? This post is for you. We have created a new article in our wiki that explains the [basic flow to interact and write code for Turpial][1]. We assume that you already have a minimum understanding of Git and that you feel comfortable with shell commands. If you have any doubt or suggestion just pass by to #turpial channel on IRC or join to our [mailing list][2] and ask your questions, we'll be glad to hear you. Check it out and tell us what do you think.
